# WAV2T-KVM-Dojo
*Building Cybersecurity Skills on a Virtual Battlefield for the Washington Veterans to Technology (WaV2T) Program*

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **Washington Veterans 2 Technology (WAV2T) KVM Dojo**, a groundbreaking initiative committed to establishing an avant-garde KVM server as the cornerstone of a state-of-the-art cybersecurity lab. Our mission is to elevate the learning experience for military service members in transition, concurrently pursuing a Certificate of Computer Science degree at St. Martin’s University with specializations in Server and Cloud Administration, Cybersecurity Administration, and Cloud Application Design. At the heart of this endeavor is a commitment to providing a platform that not only enhances academic pursuits but also serves as a catalyst for the practical skill development essential in the dynamic realm of cybersecurity. We aspire to build a system that not only imparts foundational experience but aligns seamlessly with prominent industry certifications, setting the stage for a successful journey into the cybersecurity industry.
